1. Forward simulation termination criteria when lookahead circle reaches the end must be made more robust
2. Velocity sign should be decided by the is_forward flag
3. Decide on forward simulation pipeline
    a. Build lookahead circle on tractor axle center
    b. Get the intersection point with the line segments
    c. Compute desired alpha
4. Make a complex path following test
5. Make a temporary visualizer
6. Inflate lookahead radius for one iteration if intersection is not found in first check
